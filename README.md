# Portfolio
This is a digital portfolio that will would be used to show potential employers skills and techniques in order to gain a job in Web development. The website included various ways to contact the developer. The webage employs links to projects. It has a responsive layout so the viewer can view it on a mobile phone, tablet or computer. 

The files that are contained in this project include: index.html, # style.css, an images folder with images. There is also a folder contained within the images file, for thumbnails of the screenshots of the website.


The images are placeholders for the projects since this is one of the first homework assignments. There is also an extra image (professional photos) that will be added later to the website.


The following images are screenshots of the website.
