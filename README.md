# Portfolio
This is a digital portfolio that will would be used to show potential employers skills and techniques in order to gain a job in Web development. The website included various ways to contact the developer. The webage employs links to projects. It has a responsive layout so the viewer can view it on a mobile phone, tablet or computer. 

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

Notes : 
 The files that are contained in this project include: index.html, # style.css, an images folder with images. There is also a folder contained within the images file, for thumbnails of the screenshots of the website.
